/**
 * Implementation of the Service Locator pattern. Use this class to provide dependencies without
 * making client code aware of their specific implementations (i.e., make it easier to program to
 * an interface).
 *
 * This also makes it easier to mock out dependencies during testing.
 *
 * See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern
 *
 * ### Dependencies can be defined as follows:
 *
 *   #### Lazy, app-wide Singleton:
 *   ```
 *   open val pocket by lazy { Pocket() }
 *   ```
 *
 *   #### Eager, app-wide singleton:
 *   ```
 *   open val pocket = Pocket()
 *   ```
 *
 *   #### New value each time:
 *   ```
 *   open val pocket: Pocket
 *     get() = Pocket()
 *   ```
 *
 *   #### Concrete value for interface:
 *   ```
 *   open val telemetry: TelemetryInterface by lazy { SentryWrapper() }
 *   ```
