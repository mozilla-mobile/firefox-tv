/**
 * The format with which to compress on disk. Our goals for storage:
 * - Store full resolution, with minimal artifacting: we don't know how we'll display the images in
 * future redesigns so we want to preserve them as best as possible.
 * - Take up minimal space: we don't have how many tiles the user will store.
 *
 * WebP was chosen through testing: it produces the smallest file sizes with the least amount of
 * visual artifacting but is the most computationally expensive to save (2000ms WebP vs. 200ms JPEG),
 * which is irrelevant for our infrequent screenshots.
 *
 * For file size comparisons, at 1080p, quality 50 on IMDB (a dense page):
 * - WebP is ~65 KiB with almost no artifacts
 * - JPEG is ~130 KiB with noticeable artifacts up close
 * - PNG is ~1.6MiB with no artifacts (it is lossless)

/**
 * The quality argument to [Bitmap.compress]: this value was picked through testing (see
 * [COMPRESSION_FORMAT] for goals). Here are comparisons at visual quality:
 * - 100: Possibly lossless
 * - 50: Visual artifacts essentially unnoticeable
 * - 25: Colors are muted and text starts to have noticeable compression
 *
 * Some approximate data points:
 * - IMDB quality 100: 426 KiB
 * - IMDB quality 50: 65 KiB
 * - IMDB quality 25: 43.6 KiB
 * - Google Video quality 50: 16 KiB
 * - Google Video quality 25: 13 KiB
 *
 * Since the data storage difference between 50 and 25 is negligible but there is a noticeable drop
 * in visual quality, I chose to use 50. Since these screenshots will be shrunk, we could probably
 * use lower quality but I'm concerned downscaling will make visual artifacts more significant and I
 * didn't feel it was worth the time to test.
