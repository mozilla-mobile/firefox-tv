/**
 * An interface to the Sentry crash reporting SDK. All code that touches the Sentry APIs
 * directly should go in here (like TelemetryWrapper).
 *
 * With the current implementation, to enable Sentry on Release builds, add a
 * <project-dir>/.sentry_dsn_release file with your key. To enable Sentry on Debug
 * builds, add a .sentry_dsn_debug key and in this file replace check for [isEnabled]
 * value with true (upload is disabled by default in dev builds). These keys are available
 * in the APT Google Drive -> Fire TV -> Engineering -> Secrets dir.
 *
 * The gradle output is the only way to verify if adding the key was successful (but it
 * won't indicate if the key is valid: #747). You will see a message in the gradle output
 * indicating the key was added:
 * "Sentry DSN (amazonWebviewRelease): Added from /Users/mcomella/dev/moz/firefox-tv/.sentry_dsn_release"
 * As opposed to:
 * "Sentry DSN (amazonWebviewRelease): X_X"
