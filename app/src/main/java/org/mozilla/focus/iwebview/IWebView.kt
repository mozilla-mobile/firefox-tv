     * #712: View.scrollBy will "overscroll" the page dimensions, e.g. for a page of length 500,
     * scrollBy can increment scrollY to greater values like 1000. After this, calling
     * scrollBy upwards to scrollY = 750 will still not display any changes to the user: it has
     * to make up that lost distance first.
     *
     * Scrolling and clamping appears to be the only way to prevent overscroll in Kotlin/Java,
     * which does not return the content size: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49439945/2219998. You
     * could also implement scrolling in JavaScript, but there's presumably a performance cost to
     * executing JS, separating the code could make it hard to modify, and the code would need to
     * be aware of which DOM element is being scrolled.
     *
     * For AmazonWebView, I verified that a page whose content shrinks when the user is scrolled all
     * the way to the bottom will not create an upwards scroll dead zone.
